# ðŸ¥‘ How do I use Cognosys?

You use Cognosys by telling it what you want it to do. It could be a question, a task requiring completion, or just an explanation, or some thoughts you'd want to discuss. In principle, it's easy.&#x20;

In reality, it's hard - we don't shy away from the truth that using AI is like learning to ride a horse, in certain ways - there is a developed skill called prompting, where you hone the craft of intuiting what an AI can understand and do, and slowly, progressively get better at it, with time. Prompting is the modern analogue to creative writing, in the AI epoch of human culture (& civilization).
