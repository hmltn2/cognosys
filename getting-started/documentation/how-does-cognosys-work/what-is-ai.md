# What is AI?

What? Did I read that correctly?

Yes, you did. Cognosys's backend isn't alive. It's more like a really, really advanced, adept NLP engine, that can perform standard NLP tasks like information extraction, similairty search, and question answering over documents, at a state of the art calibre / degree of performance. etc.

if you buit a house, woud you call it artificial? etf.
